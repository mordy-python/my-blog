Hey everyone and happy New Year 🎉!

I'm going to start a book log where I update my progress while reading books and then review them when I finish.

There's no better time to start than the present, so here goes for my first book.

### The Book

#### The Luminaries<br />
<small>By: Susan Dennard</small>

I started the book yesterday, January 1st, and I'm about halfway through it. I've read <em>115/304</em> pages so far.
I'm really enjoying the book. The characters are well developed and every chapter ends with something happening that makes you want to read the next chapter.
The setting is described exceptionally well and I can picture the forest in my mind.
